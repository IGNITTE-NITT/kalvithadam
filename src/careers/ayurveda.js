        <h1 className="text-center">AYURVEDA</h1>
        <p>Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicine and traces its roots to Vedic times. It is based on the curative properties of herbs and its medicines are known for the natural elements that they contain. Considered as an alternative method of treatment, the Ayurveda medicine system not only cures and prevents an ailment but also reduces the frequency with which diseases enter the human body. It utilises the self-healing system of the body. Currently, this alternative method of healing is being accepted by people worldwide. Even the World Health Organisation has provided a worldwide forum for promoting traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda. Therefore, the Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) as a course has opened up many promising opportunities for students.</p>
